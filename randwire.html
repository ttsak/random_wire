    <p>Much has been written about the optimal length of a random wire
      antenna (sometimes called a long wire antenna), some of which is
      contradictory. An antenna that will tune to an acceptable SWR
      using a common antenna tuner throughout the amateur radio bands of
      1.8-2, 3.5-4, 7-7.3, 10.1-10.15, 14-14.350, 18.068-18.168,
      21-21.45, 24.89-24.99, and 28-29.7 MHz would at a minimum entail
      using a quarter wave resonance frequency lower than the lowest
      operating frequency and avoiding lengths that are even multiples
      of a half wavelength on any of the higher frequencies. <br>
    </p>
    <p>I wrote a <a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/technote/randwire.bas">program</a> in <a href="http://www.powerbasic.com/">PowerBASIC</a> to calculate
      the gaps in the quarter-wavelength frequency spectrum over the
      range 0-30 MHz in 10 Hz steps where such resonances would be
      absent and the corresponding required electrical lengths of the
      antenna. Running the <a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/technote/randwire.exe">program</a> produced
      the following output:<br>

    In general, wider gaps are preferred. The shortest antenna that has
    a chance of tuning all bands has an electrical length of 143 feet
    and should be trimmed to give a quarter wave resonance at 1.72 MHz.
    If one were to forgo 160 meter (1.8-2 MHz) operation, an antenna
    with an electrical length of 74 feet should suffice and should be
    trimmed to give a quarter wave resonance at 3.31 MHz. These values
    assume that the antenna tuner is placed at the feed point of the
    antenna and that a suitable ground is provided.<br>
    <br>
    If there is a feedline between the antenna and the tuner, it is
    better to design the antenna to be resonant at the lowest desired
    frequency of operation, and then choose the feedline length between
    the antenna and the tuner to bring the total electrical length to
    one of the above values. Suppose, for example that one wants the
    antenna to operate at the center of the 80 meter band (3.75 MHz).
    Then the antenna must have an electrical length of 66 feet, and
    suitable feedlines would have electrical lengths of 8, 14, 16, 24,
    25, 41, 46, 77, ... feet. The required physical lengths are shorter
    as determined by the velocity factor of the feedline.<br>
